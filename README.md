# My_Self_Driving_Car
The experiments with the Udacity Self-driving Car Simulator.

Unity Code https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim

The introduction of the project is in the **Self-driving-car.ipynb**

The training details are contained in the **Behaviorial Cloning.ipynb**

Training model in the project is similar to the Nvidia model for self-driving cars.

More work is necessary to train a more efficient model, some great results can be seen in BiliBili.
